> Geoffrey S. Berman, whom President Trump abruptly dismissed last month as the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, told lawmakers on Thursday that Attorney General William P. Barr tried unsuccessfully to pressure him to resign voluntarily, warning that being fired could ruin his career.

Berman, a life-long Republican, had pursued investigations into several Trump associates, including Michael Cohen and Rudy Giuliani.

Is Susan Collins concerned? No word yet.
