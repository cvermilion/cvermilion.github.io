# No.

Trump [commuted](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-roger-stone-clemency.html) long-time associate Roger Stone's 40-month sentence, a sentence he received after being convicted of seven felonies related to obstructing a congressional investigation into Trump himself.

Mitt Romney called it ["unprecedented, historic corruption"](https://twitter.com/MittRomney/status/1281937795616067586).

Is Susan Collins concerned? No word yet.
